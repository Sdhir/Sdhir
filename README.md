ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sudhir. I am currently working as an Associate Imaging Scientist at Corteva Agriscience. 
My Ph.D. research involved designing image processing techniques and computational models that 
can facilitate automated cervical cancer diagnosis from histopathologic images of tissue biopsies. 
I have worked with various biomedical image databases like cervical histology (microscopy images), 
cervical cytology (microscopy images), chest X-ray scans, GI tract polyps from colonoscopy and 
wireless capsule endoscopy, foot prosthesis; natural image datasets like human face images 
and scene text images; and agriculture field and lab images.
